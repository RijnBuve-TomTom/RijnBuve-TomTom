Hi there, my name is Rijn Buve and you've reached my TomTom-related Github space.

On Github you can find me either as @RijnBuve-TomTom or @rijnb (personal account).
Feel free to reach out to me for any TomTom-related work or projects.

Next to my job at TomTom, I'm also involved in the Mapcode Foundation.
You can visit https://github.com/mapcode-foundation to check out my Github work
in that area.

RijnBuve-TomTom/RijnBuve-TomTom is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
